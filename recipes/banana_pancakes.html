    <h2>How to Make Banana Pancakes</h2>
    <ol>
      <strong><h3>Mix</h3></strong>
      <li>
        Combine your dry ingredients in one bowl and your wet ingredients in
        another bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet
        ingredients, then stir until they're incorporated. It's OK if your
        batter is slightly lumpy.
      </li>
      <strong><h3>Cook</h3></strong>
      <li>
        Pour the batter in ¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan or griddle
        over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes, flip with a spatula, and
        cook for another few minutes
      </li>
      <strong><h3>Serve</h3></strong>
      <li>
        Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious alone or with
        your favorite pancake toppings.
      </li>
