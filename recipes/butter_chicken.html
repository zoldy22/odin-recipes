    <p>
      This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite
      Indian dishes. It features a full-flavored sauce that complements the
      chicken well. It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the
      cayenne. Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.

    <h2>Directions to make</h2>
    <ol>
      <h3>Step 1</h3>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Sauté
        shallot and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 2</h3>
      <li>
        Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garam
        masala, chili powder, cumin, and bay leaf. Cook and stir for 1 minute.
        Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to frequently stir.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 3</h3>
      <li>
        Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10
        minutes, frequently stirring. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from
        heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 4</h3>
      <li>
        Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium
        heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 5</h3>
      <li>
        Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala and
        cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid has
        reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked chicken into sauce
        and stir together.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 6</h3>
      <li>
        Dissolve cornstarch into water, then mix into the sauce. Cook for 5 to
        10 minutes, or until thickened.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 7</h3>
      <li>Serve over rice with naan.</li>
